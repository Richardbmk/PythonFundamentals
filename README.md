# PythonFundamentals

Fundamentals concepts about Python that I've been learning since so far. It looks like this journey never ends... 

More I learn more I realizes the tone of things I don't know. 

Al the exercises and notes are from the course of Modern Python 3 Bootcamp of Coolt Steel on Udemy. Great and complete course for beginners 

I recommended to check it out.
